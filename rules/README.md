# MPLP Rules Framework

## Overview

The Rules Framework provides a comprehensive set of rules for governing the execution, validation, and integration of Multi-Agent Project Lifecycle Protocol (MPLP) components. This framework ensures consistent behavior, quality assurance, and proper coordination across all protocol modules.

## Rule Categories

### 1. Protocol Execution Rules (`execution/`)
Defines how each protocol should be executed, including:
- Execution order and dependencies
- State transitions and conditions
- Error handling and recovery procedures
- Performance and timeout constraints

### 2. Validation Rules (`validation/`)
Specifies validation criteria for:
- Input data validation
- Output quality assurance
- Schema compliance checking
- Business logic validation

### 3. Integration Rules (`integration/`)
Governs how protocols interact with each other:
- Cross-protocol communication patterns
- Data flow and transformation rules
- Dependency management
- Event propagation rules

### 4. Business Rules (`business/`)
Defines domain-specific business logic:
- Project lifecycle constraints
- Role-based access control
- Approval workflows
- Compliance requirements

### 5. Quality Rules (`quality/`)
Ensures quality standards across the system:
- Code quality metrics
- Documentation standards
- Testing requirements
- Performance benchmarks

### 6. Security Rules (`security/`)
Defines security policies and constraints:
- Authentication and authorization
- Data privacy and protection
- Audit and logging requirements
- Threat detection and response

## Rule Structure

Each rule file follows a standardized JSON structure:

```json
{
  "ruleId": "unique-rule-identifier",
  "name": "Human-readable rule name",
  "category": "execution|validation|integration|business|quality|security",
  "scope": "protocol-scope or global",
  "priority": "high|medium|low",
  "conditions": {
    "when": "condition expression",
    "context": "applicable context"
  },
  "actions": {
    "then": "action to take",
    "else": "alternative action"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "author": "rule author",
    "createdAt": "2025-06-28T11:34:54Z",
    "updatedAt": "2025-06-28T11:34:54Z"
  }
}
```

## Usage

1. **Rule Engine Integration**: Rules are processed by the MPLP Rule Engine during protocol execution
2. **Validation Pipeline**: Validation rules are applied at input/output boundaries
3. **Integration Orchestration**: Integration rules guide cross-protocol interactions
4. **Business Logic Enforcement**: Business rules ensure compliance with organizational policies
5. **Quality Assurance**: Quality rules are enforced during development and deployment
6. **Security Enforcement**: Security rules are applied at all system boundaries

## Rule Development Guidelines

1. **Clarity**: Rules should be clear, unambiguous, and well-documented
2. **Testability**: Each rule should be testable with specific test cases
3. **Modularity**: Rules should be modular and reusable across different contexts
4. **Performance**: Rules should be optimized for performance and minimal overhead
5. **Maintainability**: Rules should be easy to update and maintain
6. **Versioning**: Rules should be versioned to support evolution and rollback

## Integration with MPLP Protocols

The Rules Framework integrates with all MPLP protocols:

- **Context**: Rules for context validation and management
- **Plan**: Rules for plan validation and execution constraints
- **Execute**: Rules for execution monitoring and control
- **Test**: Rules for test execution and quality validation
- **Learn**: Rules for learning process validation and knowledge management
- **Trace**: Rules for tracing and audit requirements
- **Confirm**: Rules for confirmation and approval processes
- **Role**: Rules for role-based access and responsibility management
- **Workflow**: Rules for workflow execution and state management
- **Delivery**: Rules for deliverable validation and dependency management
