# Multi-Agent Project Lifecycle Protocol (MPLP)

> A standardized protocol framework for managing multi-agent collaborative projects throughout their entire lifecycle.

## üåü Overview

The Multi-Agent Project Lifecycle Protocol (MPLP) is a comprehensive framework designed to facilitate seamless collaboration between multiple AI agents in complex project environments. It provides structured communication patterns, task coordination mechanisms, and lifecycle management protocols.

## üß© Protocol Modules

MPLP consists of seven core protocol modules:

- **Context Protocol**: Project context establishment and environment configuration
- **Plan Protocol**: Collaborative planning and task decomposition
- **Execute Protocol**: Task execution coordination and progress tracking
- **Test Protocol**: Quality assurance and validation procedures
- **Learn Protocol**: Knowledge sharing and continuous improvement
- **Trace Protocol**: Audit trails and decision tracking
- **Confirm Protocol**: Validation workflows and consensus building

## üìã Rules Framework

The MPLP Rules Framework provides comprehensive governance for protocol execution and validation:

### Development Rules (`dev/rules/`)
A structured collection of 75 rules across 6 categories:

- **Business Rules** (5 rules): Project governance, lifecycle constraints, and approval workflows
- **Execution Rules** (30 rules): Protocol execution order, state transitions, and error handling
- **Integration Rules** (14 rules): Cross-protocol communication and system integration patterns
- **Quality Rules** (6 rules): Code standards, documentation requirements, and performance benchmarks
- **Security Rules** (6 rules): Access control, data protection, and audit requirements
- **Validation Rules** (14 rules): Input validation, schema compliance, and quality assurance

Each rule includes detailed specifications, metadata, and implementation guidelines to ensure consistent behavior across all MPLP implementations.

## üìö Documentation

All protocol specifications, schemas, examples, and rules are available in the following directories:

### Development Version (`dev/`)
- **Rules Framework**: `./dev/rules/` - Comprehensive governance rules for MPLP implementation

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For Protocol Implementation
1. Navigate to the latest release directory: `./release/v1.0.1/`
2. Review the protocol specifications in `./protocols/`
3. Check the JSON schemas in `./schemas/`
4. Explore implementation examples in `./examples/`
5. Read the documentation in your preferred language in `./docs/`

### For Development and Governance
1. Explore the Rules Framework: `./dev/rules/`
2. Review rule categories and their specifications
3. Check the comprehensive rule index: `./dev/rules/index.json`
4. Follow implementation guidelines for consistent behavior
