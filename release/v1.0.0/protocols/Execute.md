# MPLP.Execute 
 
 ## 1. Purpose  
 Defines the execution phase of a multi-agent project, where a confirmed plan is translated into concrete agent actions using specified tools, APIs, or internal logic. 
 
 ## 2. Design Rationale  
 In multi-agent systems, decentralized agents must coordinate task execution while maintaining traceability and reproducibility. This module ensures standard logging and data consistency across executions. 
 
 ## 3. Schema Field Explanation  
 - **executionId** (string): Unique identifier for this execution instance.  
 - **taskId** (string): Reference to the task being executed.  
 - **agentId** (string): The ID of the agent performing the execution.  
 - **startTime** (string, ISO 8601): When the execution started.  
 - **endTime** (string, ISO 8601, optional): When the execution ended.  
 - **status** (string): Current status (`pending` | `running` | `success` | `failed`).  
 - **input** (object): Structured input provided to the agent.  
 - **output** (object, optional): Result of the execution.  
 - **tool** (object): Details about the tool/API used. Includes:  
   - **name** (string): Name of the tool or API.  
   - **version** (string, optional): Version number.  
   - **endpoint** (string, optional): API endpoint or function reference.  
 - **error** (string, optional): If status is `failed`, describes the error. 
 
 ## 4. Interaction Flow  
 1. Execution request is triggered by a confirmed plan.  
 2. Agent selects appropriate tool or method.  
 3. Task is executed and tracked in real-time.  
 4. On completion, outputs and metadata are logged.  
 5. If failure occurs, error info is captured and sent to Learn module. 
 
 ## 5. Recommended Execution Model  
 - Use standardized I/O schema to facilitate cross-agent interoperability.  
 - Each execution must have traceable input/output, regardless of success.  
 - Failures should trigger Learn or retry logic based on policy. 
 
 ## 6. Example Usage  
 ```json 
 { 
   "executionId": "exec-3001", 
   "taskId": "task-1001", 
   "agentId": "agent-data-scraper", 
   "startTime": "2025-06-28T12:00:00Z", 
   "endTime": "2025-06-28T12:02:30Z", 
   "status": "success", 
   "input": { 
     "url": "https://example.com/data-feed" 
   }, 
   "output": { 
     "itemsExtracted": 245 
   }, 
   "tool": { 
     "name": "web-scraper-v2", 
     "version": "2.3.1", 
     "endpoint": "scraper.fetchHTML" 
   } 
 } 
 ``` 
 
 ## 7. Notes & Extensions 
 Output format should support semantic structure (e.g. JSON-LD). 
 
 Execution may include retry policy, fallback agents, or parallel execution. 
 
 Future versions may define quality scores or confidence levels for output.
