# MPLP.Confirm — Confirmation Protocol

## Purpose
This protocol freezes intent and enables multi-round confirmation to prevent execution drift and ensure alignment with user expectations.

## Structure (TBD)
> TODO: Define confirmation schema, approval workflow, rollback mechanisms, etc.

## Suggested Execution Model
> Multi-stage confirmation with checkpoints and user approval gates.
> Standard lifecycle: capture → freeze → review → approve → proceed
