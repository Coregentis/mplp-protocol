# MPLP.Learn Schema

## Overview

**MPLP.Learn** provides a standardized framework for representing learning processes, feedback, and strategy evolution in multi-agent environments. It enables agents to adapt and improve their performance based on execution outcomes and environmental feedback.

## Purpose

- **Adaptive Behavior**: Enable agents to learn from experience and improve performance
- **Failure Recovery**: Capture and learn from failures to prevent recurrence
- **Knowledge Evolution**: Continuously update agent knowledge and capabilities
- **Performance Optimization**: Adjust strategies based on observed outcomes
- **Collective Intelligence**: Share learning insights across agent teams
