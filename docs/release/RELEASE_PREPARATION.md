# 📦 Release Preparation Guide

**Guidelines for preparing MPLP for public open-source release**

---

## 🎯 Release Philosophy

The **Multi-Agent Project Lifecycle Protocol (MPLP)** is the core focus of this project. When preparing for public release, we must ensure that:

1. **Protocol-Focused**: The release should focus on the protocol specifications, schemas, and examples
2. **Clean Documentation**: Remove all internal development processes and commercial-grade tooling references
3. **Open Source Ready**: Ensure all content is appropriate for open-source community consumption

## 📋 Pre-Release Checklist

### ✅ Content Review

- [ ] **README.md** focuses on protocol introduction and usage
- [ ] **No commercial development processes** mentioned in public docs
- [ ] **Protocol modules** are clearly documented
- [ ] **Examples and schemas** are complete and validated
- [ ] **Multilingual documentation** is up to date

### ✅ File Structure

- [ ] **release/v1.0.2/** contains the clean, frozen release
- [ ] **DEVELOPMENT.md** is excluded from public release (in .gitignore)
- [ ] **Internal scripts and configs** are properly categorized
- [ ] **Public documentation** references only public content

### ✅ Documentation Quality

- [ ] **Protocol specifications** are complete
- [ ] **JSON schemas** are validated
- [ ] **Usage examples** work correctly
- [ ] **Getting started guide** is clear and concise
- [ ] **Contributing guidelines** are community-friendly

## 🚀 Release Process

### 1. Content Preparation

```bash
# Validate all public content
npm run validate:schemas
npm run validate:examples
npm test
```

### 2. Documentation Review

- Review `README.md` for protocol focus
- Ensure `release/v1.0.2/` is complete
- Verify multilingual docs are current
- Check that examples are working

### 3. Public Release

The public release should include:

```
mplp-protocol/
├── README.md                    # Protocol-focused introduction
├── LICENSE                      # MIT License
├── package.json                 # Basic package info
├── release/v1.0.2/             # Stable release content
│   ├── protocols/              # Protocol specifications
│   ├── schemas/                # JSON Schema files
│   ├── examples/               # Usage examples
│   └── docs/                   # Multilingual documentation
└── CONTRIBUTING.md             # Community contribution guide
```

### 4. Exclusions for Public Release

The following should **NOT** be included in public releases:

- `DEVELOPMENT.md` - Internal development guide
- `scripts/` - Internal automation scripts
- `config/` - Development configuration files
- `dev/` - Development workspace (unless specifically needed)
- Enterprise-grade release management documentation
- Commercial development process references

## 📝 Key Messages for Public Release

### Primary Focus
- **Multi-Agent Project Lifecycle Protocol** is a standardized framework
- **Language-agnostic** and **modular** design
- **Complete lifecycle coverage** from context to delivery
- **JSON Schema validation** for data structures
- **Multilingual support** for global adoption

### Community Benefits
- **Open standard** for multi-agent collaboration
- **Extensible design** for various use cases
- **Comprehensive documentation** and examples
- **Active development** and community support

## 🔍 Quality Assurance

### Before Public Release

1. **Content Audit**: Ensure no internal processes are documented
2. **Link Validation**: All public links work correctly
3. **Example Testing**: All code examples execute successfully
4. **Schema Validation**: All JSON schemas are valid
5. **Documentation Completeness**: All protocol modules are documented

### Post-Release Monitoring

1. **Community Feedback**: Monitor issues and discussions
2. **Documentation Updates**: Keep docs current with protocol evolution
3. **Example Maintenance**: Ensure examples remain functional
4. **Schema Evolution**: Manage schema changes carefully

## 🎯 Success Metrics

A successful public release should:

- **Clear Value Proposition**: Users understand what MPLP is and why it's useful
- **Easy Adoption**: Developers can quickly start using the protocol
- **Complete Documentation**: All necessary information is available
- **Community Engagement**: Active participation from the open-source community
- **Protocol Focus**: Emphasis on the protocol itself, not development tooling

**Remember**: The goal is to share the Multi-Agent Project Lifecycle Protocol with the world, not our internal development processes.
