# MPLP.Execute — Execution Protocol

## Purpose
This protocol handles execution, I/O normalization, and tool/API calls for multi-agent task implementation.

## Structure (TBD)
> TODO: Define execution schema, I/O formats, tool interface specifications, etc.

## Suggested Execution Model
> Standardized execution engine with normalized input/output and error handling.
> Standard lifecycle: prepare → execute → monitor → validate → report
