# MPLP.Learn — Learning Protocol

## Purpose
This protocol enables self-improvement, failure analysis, and strategy evolution for multi-agent systems.

## Structure (TBD)
> TODO: Define learning schema, feedback mechanisms, knowledge base format, etc.

## Suggested Execution Model
> Continuous learning cycle with failure analysis and strategy optimization.
> Standard lifecycle: observe → analyze → learn → adapt → improve
