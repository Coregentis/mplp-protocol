# MPLP.Plan — Planning Protocol

## Purpose
This protocol defines structured tasks, agent assignments, and DSL schemas for multi-agent project planning and coordination.

## Structure (TBD)

## Suggested Execution Model
> Hierarchical task decomposition with agent capability matching.
> Standard lifecycle: analyze → decompose → assign → validate → execute
